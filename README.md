samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Goals
### What is the problem to solve?
An app that allows for users to create decks and search cards for the card game Union Arena. 

### Why this problem is important to solve?
Currently, there isn't a mobile app that allows for creation of decks for the game, which makes it difficult to keep track of what you may or may not have. It also makes it easy to know what cards you need to buy if you wanted to make a deck physically.

### How do I solve this problem?
Create a deck building app using a third-party API that has access to all of the currently released Union Arena cards. Allow for users on the app to create accounts and have them be able to build decks and save them to their accounts.
